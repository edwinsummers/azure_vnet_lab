# Azure VNet Lab

Terraform scripts to build infrastructure in Microsoft Azure to test basic VNet concepts.

*Note: This infrastructure includes resources that incur cost. Costs should be minor due to use of low-tier virtual machine sizes and dynamically-assigned public IP addresses. Reference the [Azure Pricing documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) if you have any questions on resource costs. I strongly recommend destroying this infrastructure using `terraform destroy` when it is not in use.*
